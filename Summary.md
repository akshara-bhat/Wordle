# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the brackets with
point values.

## Transcripts

Paste transcripts into the below sections. Put each within triple back-quotes,
like this:

```
This is an example.
```

All transcripts should start with the first text output from the program.
Provide a transcript even if your code did not work correctly. **Do not** modify
transcripts.

### Transcript 1

_Paste in the transcript for Problem 1. It should show at least one win and one loss
with the text-human combination._ [5 points]

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

Yes

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

5 hours

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours. We especially
like hearing about helpful TAs._ [1 points]

Saumya and Akshara did pair programming. We worked on every part of the assignment together and we also attended office hours with Professor Rasika to get some extra aid. 


### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._ [1 point]

Yes, we did use AI. We used Claude AI to help us with a few questions we had regarding Interfaces and higher order functions. 
Here are the prompts we used: 
1. What is ".first" in kotlin 
2. Can you give us a list of all higher order functions in Kotlin? 
3. How do interfaces differ from regular classes? 
4. "it." uses in kotlin 
5. is it "it[index] == letter" or "it[index].letter" if I am adding letter to the index? 

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful._ [2 points] 

We used a few websites and articles to help us understand interfaces and object oriented programming. Here are the URLs we used: 
"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html#function-types"
"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-interfaces/"

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of this assignment was the last function "incorporate Feedback". We took Jessica Meng's help with figuring out the logic behind the algorithm 
The most rewarding part of the assignment for us was playing the game repeatedly after we were done coding it. We enjoy NYT games and we had a blast playing the game over and over. 
By doing this assignment, we learned more about object oriented programming and higher order functions. We learned how to use "it" in various places and we also got to witness the 
combination of GUI and our coding to create this project.
